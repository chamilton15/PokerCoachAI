TOP RECOMMENDATIONS
======================================================================

#1: REDUCE WEAK CALLS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE:
  You're calling too often with weak hands
  Frequency: 24 times (43% of hands)

EXAMPLES:
  • Hand #16: Preflop facing none with score_5 from UTG → You cc, Optimal: fold
  • Hand #45: Preflop facing none with score_5 from UTG → You cc, Optimal: fold

WHY THIS MATTERS:
  Calling with weak hands in bad spots loses money over time

HOW TO IMPROVE:
  ✓ Be more selective about which hands you call with
  ✓ Fold more often when out of position with marginal hands
  ✓ Consider 3-betting or folding instead of passively calling
  ✓ Respect raises from tight players - they usually have it

ESTIMATED IMPACT: +21.4 BB/100 hands potential improvement

#2: STOP OVER-FOLDING
----------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE:
  You're folding too often in profitable situations
  Frequency: 3 times (5% of hands)

EXAMPLES:
  • Hand #1: Preflop facing none with score_5 from HJ → You f, Optimal: raise
  • Hand #40: Preflop facing none with score_5 from HJ → You f, Optimal: raise

WHY THIS MATTERS:
  You're leaving money on the table by being too cautious

HOW TO IMPROVE:
  ✓ Call more often with medium-strength hands when in position
  ✓ Don't treat single raises as super-strong - many players raise wide
  ✓ Consider your pot odds - if getting 3:1 or better, call lighter
  ✓ Medium pairs (66-99) are often profitable calls in position

ESTIMATED IMPACT: +2.7 BB/100 hands potential improvement

#3: INCREASE AGGRESSION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE:
  You're playing too passively with strong hands
  Frequency: 3 times (5% of hands)

EXAMPLES:
  • Hand #290: Preflop facing none with score_5 from HJ → You cc, Optimal: raise
  • Hand #368: Preflop facing none with score_5 from HJ → You cc, Optimal: raise

WHY THIS MATTERS:
  Passive play misses value and makes you predictable

HOW TO IMPROVE:
  ✓ Raise more often with premium hands - build the pot
  ✓ Don't slow-play too often - aggressive play wins more
  ✓ Add some 3-bets to your game with strong hands
  ✓ Bet for value when you think you're ahead

ESTIMATED IMPACT: +2.7 BB/100 hands potential improvement
