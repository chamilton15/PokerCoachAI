TOP RECOMMENDATIONS
======================================================================

#1: REDUCE WEAK CALLS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE:
  You're calling too often with weak hands
  Frequency: 1 times (11% of hands)

EXAMPLES:
  • Hand #16: Preflop facing none with score_5 from UTG → You cc, Optimal: fold

WHY THIS MATTERS:
  Calling with weak hands in bad spots loses money over time

HOW TO IMPROVE:
  ✓ Be more selective about which hands you call with
  ✓ Fold more often when out of position with marginal hands
  ✓ Consider 3-betting or folding instead of passively calling
  ✓ Respect raises from tight players - they usually have it

ESTIMATED IMPACT: +5.6 BB/100 hands potential improvement

#2: STOP OVER-FOLDING
----------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE:
  You're folding too often in profitable situations
  Frequency: 1 times (11% of hands)

EXAMPLES:
  • Hand #44: Preflop facing none with score_5 from HJ → You f, Optimal: raise

WHY THIS MATTERS:
  You're leaving money on the table by being too cautious

HOW TO IMPROVE:
  ✓ Call more often with medium-strength hands when in position
  ✓ Don't treat single raises as super-strong - many players raise wide
  ✓ Consider your pot odds - if getting 3:1 or better, call lighter
  ✓ Medium pairs (66-99) are often profitable calls in position

ESTIMATED IMPACT: +5.6 BB/100 hands potential improvement
