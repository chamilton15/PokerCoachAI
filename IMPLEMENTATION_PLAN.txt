                SIMPLIFIED POKER COACH AI - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
                    (Build Your Own Model Variation)
================================================================================

GOAL: Analyze Hero's 56 hands and provide actionable feedback
      WITHOUT needing full CFR+ implementation initially

PHILOSOPHY: Start simple, learn the fundamentals, build your own approach

================================================================================
                        PHASE 1: FOUNDATION
                    (Week 1 - Get Something Working)
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE: Parse data, calculate basic stats, understand the game states

STEP 1.1: Build Hand History Parser
---------------------------------------------------------
Input:  abs_NLH_handhq_1_Hero_extracted.phhs
Output: Structured Python objects for each hand

What to extract:
• Hero's hole cards (if visible)
• Hero's position (seat number → position name)
• Actions sequence (who did what, when)
• Pot size at each decision point
• Hero's stack size
• Board cards (flop, turn, river if reached)
• Outcome (winnings)

Deliverable: parser.py with Hand class
Time: 1-2 days

STEP 1.2: Calculate Basic Statistics
---------------------------------------------------------
Analyze Hero across all 56 hands:

Core Poker Stats:
• VPIP (Voluntarily Put $ In Pot) %
• PFR (Pre-Flop Raise) %  
• 3-bet %
• Fold to 3-bet %
• C-bet (Continuation Bet) %
• Aggression Factor (bets+raises / calls)
• Hands played by position

Deliverable: statistics.py with calculate_stats() function
Time: 1 day

STEP 1.3: Position Analysis
---------------------------------------------------------
Poker positions (strongest → weakest):
1. Button (BTN) - best position
2. Cut-off (CO)
3. Hijack (HJ)
4. Middle positions (MP)
5. Under the gun (UTG) - worst position

Calculate Hero's stats BY POSITION:
• VPIP from Button vs UTG
• Win rate by position
• Aggression by position

Why: Position is HUGE in poker. This reveals if Hero understands positional advantage.

Deliverable: Add position_stats() to statistics.py
Time: 1 day

EXPECTED WEEK 1 OUTPUT:
"""
HERO SESSION ANALYSIS - BASIC STATS
====================================
Hands Played: 56
VPIP: 22.5%
PFR: 14.3%
Aggression Factor: 2.1

POSITION BREAKDOWN:
Button:  VPIP 35% (7 hands)
Cut-off: VPIP 25% (8 hands)
UTG:     VPIP 12% (9 hands)
"""

================================================================================
                    PHASE 2: SIMPLIFIED GTO MODEL
                (Week 2 - Your Own Strategy Baseline)
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE: Build simplified "optimal" strategy using poker fundamentals
           (NOT full CFR+, but a reasonable approximation)

THE APPROACH: Use Poker Theory + Hand Strength + Position

STEP 2.1: Hand Strength Evaluator
---------------------------------------------------------
Create a simplified hand ranking system:

Pre-flop Hand Strength (Chen Formula or similar):
• Premium pairs (AA, KK, QQ): Score 10
• Medium pairs (99-JJ): Score 8
• Small pairs (22-88): Score 6
• Ace-King suited: Score 9
• Ace-King offsuit: Score 7
• Broadway cards (AQ, KQ, etc.): Score 5-7
• Suited connectors: Score 4-6
• Trash: Score 1-3

Post-flop Hand Strength:
• Use hand evaluator library (treys or pokersolver)
• Calculate: pair, two-pair, trips, straight, flush, etc.
• Relative strength: top pair vs bottom pair

Deliverable: hand_strength.py with evaluate_hand() function
Time: 1-2 days

STEP 2.2: Simplified GTO Strategy Rules
---------------------------------------------------------
Build YOUR OWN simplified optimal strategy based on:
1. Hand strength
2. Position
3. Stack size (deep vs short)
4. Number of opponents

SIMPLIFIED STRATEGY TABLE:

Pre-flop from UTG (tight):
• Raise: Premium pairs (QQ+), AKs, AKo (top 10% of hands)
• Fold: Everything else
• Call: Never (UTG should be aggressive or fold)

Pre-flop from Button (loose):
• Raise: All pairs, all broadway, suited connectors (top 40% of hands)
• Call: Suited connectors, small pairs (if someone raised)
• Fold: Trash hands

Post-flop C-bet frequency:
• If you raised pre-flop: C-bet 60-70% of flops
• If heads-up: C-bet more (70%)
• If multi-way: C-bet less (50%)

3-bet defense:
• Facing 3-bet: Call/re-raise ~50% of your opening range
• Don't fold premium hands
• Don't call with weak hands

This is SIMPLIFIED GTO approximation based on poker theory!

Deliverable: strategy_baseline.py with optimal_action() function
Time: 2-3 days

STEP 2.3: Compare Hero vs Your Baseline
---------------------------------------------------------
For each Hero decision:

1. Reconstruct the situation:
   - Hero's hand strength (score 1-10)
   - Hero's position
   - Action to Hero (check, bet, raise)
   - Pot odds

2. Get YOUR baseline recommendation:
   baseline_action = optimal_action(hand_strength, position, action_to_hero)
   # Returns: ("raise", probability=0.70)

3. Compare:
   if hero_action != baseline_action:
       → Flag as potential mistake
       → Categorize mistake type

Deliverable: analyzer.py with compare_to_baseline() function
Time: 2 days

EXPECTED WEEK 2 OUTPUT:
"""
HERO vs BASELINE ANALYSIS
=========================

Agreement Rate: 68% (38/56 hands)
Mistakes Found: 18 hands

MISTAKE BREAKDOWN:
1. Over-folding to raises: 7 instances
   - Example: Hand #5 - Folded 77 to single raise from CO
   - Baseline says: Call (medium pair, good position)

2. Under-bluffing on flop: 5 instances
   - Example: Hand #12 - Checked with air on dry flop
   - Baseline says: C-bet 65% of time

3. Wrong position play: 4 instances
   - Played too tight from Button
   - Baseline says: Open wider from best position
"""

================================================================================
                    PHASE 3: FEEDBACK GENERATION
                (Week 3 - Make It Useful)
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE: Turn analysis into actionable coaching advice

STEP 3.1: Pattern Recognition
---------------------------------------------------------
Aggregate mistakes into patterns:

def find_patterns(mistakes):
    patterns = {
        'over_folding': [],
        'under_bluffing': [],
        'position_errors': [],
        'bet_sizing': []
    }
    
    for mistake in mistakes:
        patterns[mistake.type].append(mistake)
    
    return patterns

Identify the TOP 3 most costly patterns

Deliverable: feedback.py with find_patterns() function
Time: 1 day

STEP 3.2: Generate Recommendations
---------------------------------------------------------
For each pattern, generate specific advice:

Template:
"""
RECOMMENDATION #{number}: {Title}

ISSUE:
You {description of mistake} in {frequency} instances.

EXAMPLES:
- Hand #X: {specific example}
- Hand #Y: {specific example}

WHY THIS MATTERS:

HOW TO IMPROVE:
{Specific actionable advice}

IMPACT:
Fixing this could improve your win rate by ~{estimate} BB/100 hands
"""

Deliverable: feedback.py with generate_recommendations() function
Time: 1-2 days

STEP 3.3: Create Report Generator
---------------------------------------------------------
Put it all together into nice output:

def generate_report(hero_hands):
    # 1. Basic statistics
    # 2. Comparison to baseline
    # 3. Top 3 recommendations
    # 4. Visualizations (optional)
    
    return formatted_report

Deliverable: report.py with generate_report() function
Time: 1 day

EXPECTED WEEK 3 OUTPUT:
"""
========================================
POKER COACH AI - SESSION ANALYSIS
========================================

PLAYER: Hero
HANDS: 56
DATE: July 1, 2009
GAME: $0.50 NL Hold'em

OVERALL STATISTICS
==================
VPIP: 22.5% (Baseline: 25-30% optimal)
PFR:  14.3% (Baseline: 18-22% optimal)
Aggression: 2.1 (Good! Target: 2.0-2.5)

ANALYSIS: Slightly too tight overall

TOP 3 RECOMMENDATIONS
=====================

#1: STOP OVER-FOLDING TO SINGLE RAISES
   
   ISSUE:
   You folded medium pairs (77, 88) to single raises 
   from good positions 7 times out of 9 opportunities.
   
   EXAMPLES:
   - Hand #5: Folded 77 from Cut-off vs UTG raise
     → Baseline: Call (pot odds 3:1, good position)
   - Hand #18: Folded 88 from Button vs MP raise  
     → Baseline: Call or 3-bet (strongest position!)
   
   WHY THIS MATTERS:
   Medium pairs are profitable calls in position. You're 
   leaving money on the table by being too cautious.
   
   HOW TO IMPROVE:
   ✓ Call with 77+ when in position (CO, Button)
   ✓ Consider 3-betting sometimes to apply pressure
   ✓ Don't treat single raises as super-strong
   
   IMPACT: +1.5 BB/100 hands (~$15/10k hands at $0.50 stakes)

#2: ADD CONTINUATION BETS TO YOUR GAME

   ISSUE:
   When you raised pre-flop and missed the flop, you 
   checked 100% of the time (0/8 C-bet opportunities).
   
   EXAMPLES:
   - Hand #23: Raised AK, missed flop, checked
     → Baseline: C-bet 65% of time (represent strength)
   
   WHY THIS MATTERS:
   Never bluffing makes you predictable. Opponents can 
   easily fold when you bet (only strong hands) and bet 
   when you check (you have nothing).
   
   HOW TO IMPROVE:
   ✓ C-bet 60-70% of flops when heads-up
   ✓ C-bet more on dry boards (hard to hit)
   ✓ C-bet less on wet boards (many draws possible)
   ✓ Don't need a hand to bet - position is enough
   
   IMPACT: +0.8 BB/100 hands (~$8/10k hands)

#3: USE YOUR BUTTON POSITION MORE

   ISSUE:
   You only played 35% of hands from the Button.
   This is the most profitable position!
   
   WHY THIS MATTERS:
   Button acts last on every street - huge advantage.
   Winning players open 40-50% of hands here.
   
   HOW TO IMPROVE:
   ✓ Open wider from Button (any pair, any ace, suited cards)
   ✓ Steal blinds more often (they'll often fold)
   ✓ Use position to control pot size
   
   IMPACT: +0.5 BB/100 hands (~$5/10k hands)

SUMMARY
=======
You're playing solid fundamental poker but TOO TIGHT.
Being conservative is good, but you're missing profitable 
spots. Main areas to work on:

1. Call more with medium strength hands in position
2. Bluff occasionally (c-bets) to balance your range  
3. Exploit Button position advantage

ESTIMATED TOTAL IMPROVEMENT: +2.8 BB/100 hands

Keep up the good value betting with strong hands!
Your aggression when you have it is solid.

================================================================================
                PHASE 4 (OPTIONAL): ADD SIMPLE ML
            (Week 4 - If You Want to Go Further)
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE: Add pattern learning on top of your baseline

APPROACH: Simple Neural Network for Mistake Classification

Input Features (per hand):
• Hand strength score (1-10)
• Position (0-5)
• Number of opponents (1-8)
• Stack size (normalized)
• Pot odds (ratio)
• Hero's action (encoded)
• Baseline recommended action (encoded)

Output:
• Mistake probability (0-1)
• Mistake type (classification)

Architecture:
• Simple feedforward neural network
• 2-3 hidden layers (64, 32 neurons)
• Trained on your baseline labels

This is optional but shows ML application!

Deliverable: ml_model.py with simple neural net
Time: 1 week (if desired)

================================================================================
                    SIMPLIFIED GTO STRATEGY RULES
                    (Your Baseline - Customize This!)
================================================================================

This is the CORE of your model. Adjust based on poker research!

PRE-FLOP STRATEGY BY POSITION:

UTG (Under the Gun - Tightest):
    RAISE: QQ+, AK (top 8%)
    FOLD: Everything else
    Reasoning: Worst position, 8 players behind you

Middle Position:
    RAISE: 99+, AJ+, KQ (top 15%)
    CALL: Small pairs vs raise (set mining)
    FOLD: Weak hands
    Reasoning: Medium position, fewer players behind

Cut-off:
    RAISE: 77+, AT+, KJ+, suited connectors (top 25%)
    CALL: Small pairs, suited cards vs raise
    FOLD: True trash
    Reasoning: Good position, 2 players behind

Button (Loosest):
    RAISE: Any pair, any ace, any two broadways, 
           suited connectors (top 40%)
    CALL: Any playable hand vs raise
    FOLD: Only trash (72o, 83o, etc.)
    Reasoning: Best position, last to act

POST-FLOP STRATEGY:

C-bet (Continuation Bet) Frequency:
    IF raised pre-flop AND heads-up:
        C-bet: 65% of flops
        Check: 35% of flops
    
    IF raised pre-flop AND multi-way:
        C-bet: 45% of flops (need stronger hand)
    
    Board texture matters:
        Dry board (K-7-2 rainbow): C-bet 75%
        Wet board (J-10-9 two-tone): C-bet 50%

Facing 3-bet:
    IF you raised and faced 3-bet:
        With premium (QQ+, AK): 4-bet or call
        With medium (JJ, AQ): Call in position, fold OOP
        With bluffs: Fold most of the time
        
    Defense rate: ~50% of opening range

Bet Sizing:
    C-bet: 50-70% of pot
    Value bet: 60-80% of pot  
    Bluff: 50-60% of pot (same as value)

These rules are your "optimal" baseline!

================================================================================
                    TESTING STRATEGY
================================================================================

How to validate your model:

TEST 1: Parse Validation
    • Can you parse all 56 hands without errors?
    • Do extracted values match manual inspection?

TEST 2: Statistics Validation
    • Does VPIP + fold % = 100%?
    • Does PFR <= VPIP? (logical consistency)
    • Do position stats sum correctly?

TEST 3: Strategy Validation
    • Does baseline recommend raising AA 100% of time? (sanity check)
    • Does baseline play tighter from UTG than Button? (should be true)
    • Manual test: Run 5-10 hands, check recommendations make sense

TEST 4: End-to-End Test
    • Run full analysis on Hero's 56 hands
    • Do recommendations seem reasonable?
    • Ask someone who plays poker: "Does this advice make sense?"

TEST 5: Edge Case Testing
    • What if Hero always folds? (should recommend playing more)
    • What if Hero always raises? (should recommend playing tighter)

================================================================================
                    SUCCESS CRITERIA
================================================================================

MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT (Week 3):
✓ Parses all 56 Hero hands successfully
✓ Calculates accurate statistics (VPIP, PFR, etc.)
✓ Compares to simplified baseline strategy

    touch poker_coach/__init__.py
    touch main.py requirements.txt

STEP 2 (Today): Install dependencies
    Create requirements.txt with:
        # None needed yet! Pure Python for Phase 1
        # Later: numpy, pandas, matplotlib

STEP 3 (Tomorrow): Start building parser.py
    Goal: Read one hand from .phhs file
    Test: Print Hero's cards and action for Hand #1

STEP 4: Build incrementally
    Each component → Test → Next component

YOU CAN DO THIS IN 3 WEEKS!

================================================================================
                    KEY DESIGN DECISIONS
================================================================================

DECISION 1: Simplified vs Full CFR+
    CHOICE: Start simplified
    REASON: Learn fundamentals, iterate faster, 80% value in 20% time

DECISION 2: Rule-based vs Pure ML
    CHOICE: Rule-based baseline, ML optional later
    REASON: Interpretable, easier to debug, poker has known theory

DECISION 3: Custom strategy vs Off-the-shelf
    CHOICE: Build your own simplified strategy
    REASON: Educational, customizable, understand every decision

DECISION 4: Language
    CHOICE: Python
    REASON: Easy, good libraries, fast prototyping

DECISION 5: Scope
    CHOICE: Hero's 56 hands only
    REASON: Focused, achievable, proves concept

These decisions optimize for LEARNING + ACHIEVABILITY!

================================================================================
                    FINAL ADVICE
================================================================================

1. Start SIMPLE
   Don't try to build CFR+ on day 1. Build parser first.

2. Test FREQUENTLY  
   Test each component before moving to next.

3. Iterate QUICKLY
   Get something working end-to-end, then improve.

4. Keep it PRACTICAL
   Focus on generating useful feedback, not perfect accuracy.

5. Learn DEEPLY
   Understand why each component works, don't just copy code.

6. Have FUN
   This is a cool project! Enjoy building something useful.

YOU'VE GOT THIS!

Start with parser.py tomorrow. Get one hand parsed and printed.
That's success for Day 1.
